## preparing SNPtest chromosome output files for LDSC ##

# cd to directory where your SNPtest output is
cd $HOME/DIET/MR/OUTPUT

# just in case, backup your SNPtest output, e.g. in a temporary backup folder
mkdir BACKUP
mv *.out ./BACKUP

# remember that SNPtest gives separate output for each chromosome.
# in this case, I'm assuming that the !!ALL!! *.out files in the folder are raw output (!!) and that you want
# prepare them for LDSC.
# If this is not the case (!!e.g. if the *.out files are not raw and already prepared for ldsc format!!),
# you could write a loop that repeats the edits for the files you'd particularly like to change.
# alternatively, move the raw output to a different folder.

## remove headers (which consist of 16 lines) ##
sed -i '1,16d' *.out

## remove tails ##
sed -i '$d' *.out

## cut out relevant columns (! change file name as needed !)##
